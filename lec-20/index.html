<!-- The CSS positions allow you to precisely control the placement of an element on the web page. It helps to determine how elements are placed inside the container element and how they interact with the other elements on the page. -->

<!-- If we want to use Z-index then we need to set a position type in the div -->

<!-- Static(Default)
The elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

Syntax:

selector {
      position: static;
} -->

<!-- Absolute
Elements are positioned relative to the closest positioned ancestor (parent), which means we need to have a parent element with a positioning other than 'static'.
Note: An absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal flow. -->

<!-- Fixed
Elements are positioned relative to the viewport (screen) and do not move when the page is scrolled. This is useful for creating elements like fixed headers or footers. -->

<!-- Sticky
Position sticky is a hybrid between 'relative' and 'fixed'.
It allows an element to become "stuck" to the top or bottom of its container when scrolling, but it behaves like relative positioning within the container until it reaches a specified offset. -->


<!-- summery:
CSS position - to manipulate the location of an element

1- position: static;  //(by default property , no effect of top, bottom, left, right, z-index) 
2- position: relative;  //(shift the position according to its actual position)
3- position: absolute: //(shift the position to its nearest parent element)
4- position: fixed; // same as absolute, except the element is positioned relative to browser window
                                  no effect of scroll

5- position: sticky; // element is positioned based on scroll position, until the scroll location of the viewport reaches a specified threshold. (when scroll in sticky container it behaves like static) -->
